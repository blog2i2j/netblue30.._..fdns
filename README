What is fdns?
-----------
fdns is a DNS-over-HTTPS proxy server targeted at small networks and
Linux desktops. To speed up the name resolution fdns caches the responses,
and uses a configurable adblocker and privacy filter to cut down the
unnecessary traffic.

The software is written in C, and is licensed under GPLv3.
Adblock filters installed in /etc/fnds directory are preserving the original license
of the source used for building them:

     /etc/fdns/adblocker - MIT license
     /etc/fdns/coinblocker - AGPLv3 license
     /etc/fdns/fp-trackers - MIT license
     /etc/fdns/trackers - GPLv3 license


Build and Install
-----------------
Dependencies: OpenSSL library, libseccomp
  - Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libseccomp-dev libssl-dev
  - Fedora/CentOS: sudo yum install libseccomp-devel openssl-devel
  - Arch Linux: the libraries are already included by the base meta package

Build and install: ./configure && make && sudo make install
If AppArmor is present in the system, enable fdns profile by running
# /sbin/apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.fdns
