FDNS is an encrypted DNS proxy designed for small networks and Linux desktops. Lean and mean, it protects your computer from some of the most common cyber threats, while also improving privacy and the system performance.

FDNS is written in C and licensed under GPLv3. We use only DoH and DoT services from non-logging and non-censoring providers, while preferring small operators such as open-source enthusiasts and privacy-oriented non-profit organizations.

<h2>Development release 0.9.75:</h2>

Introducing DNS over QUIC support on a small number of servers, both adblocker and family flavors:
`````
$ fdns --list=quic
Current zone: America
adguard-unfiltered-quic - anycast, quic, America, AsiaPacific, Europe
	https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html
adguard-unfiltered2-quic - anycast, quic, America, AsiaPacific, Europe
	https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html
adguard-quic - anycast, quic, adblocker, America, AsiaPacific, Europe
	https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html
adguard2-quic - anycast, quic, adblocker, America, AsiaPacific, Europe
	https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html
4 servers found

$ fdns --list=family
Current zone: America
[...]
adguard-family-quic - quic, family, America, AsiaPacific, Europe
	https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html
adguard-family2-quic - anycast, quic, family, America, AsiaPacific, Europe
	https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html
[...]
`````
A short comparison of DoH, DoT, and DoQ:
`````
$ fdns --test-server
Current zone: America

Testing server adguard-unfiltered
   Tags: anycast, America, AsiaPacific, Europe
   SSL/TLS connection: 122.96 ms
   DoH query average: 22.22 ms
   DoH/Do53 bandwidth ratio: 2.13

Testing server adguard-unfiltered-dot
   Tags: anycast, dot, America, AsiaPacific, Europe
   SSL/TLS connection: 146.72 ms
   DoT query average: 20.88 ms
   DoT/Do53 bandwidth ratio: 1.32

Testing server adguard-unfiltered-quic
   Tags: anycast, quic, America, AsiaPacific, Europe
   SSL/TLS connection: 485.44 ms
   DoQ query average: 22.92 ms
[...]
`````
Larger connection time, similar query time average, the bandwidth requirements are believed to be similar to DoT or lower. We will add more DoQ servers as the technology matures.
