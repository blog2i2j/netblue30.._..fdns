.SH NAME
nxdomain \- simple utility program to clean up hosts files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
nxdomain [options] file-in [file-out]

.SH DESCRIPTION
nxdomain is a program that removes dead domains from a host list.
The program accepts regular hosts files with IP addresses of 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0,
or lists of domain names without IP address, one domain per line.
The default upstream resolver is Cloudflare 1.1.1.1.
.br

.br
By default, the program is using 5 resolver threads, each thread running at 10 queries per second,
for a grand total of 50 queries per second. If you take into account the time necessary to the upstream
DNS server to respond, the number is much lower. I am getting about 30 queries per second on Cloudflare,
on a regular home Internet connection.
